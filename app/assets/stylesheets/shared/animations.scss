// Contains canned animations for Angular.
// Dependent on the excellent Animate.css library.
//
// Each animation is provided in two avatars:
// 1. As a Sass mixin for use in your own classes
// 2. As a class for use directly on some element
//
// Both the mixin and the class for an animation have the same name, and they
// all begin with the 'anim-' prefix. Mixins are more flexible as they can be
// configured with arguments, whereas classes only work with the defaults.
