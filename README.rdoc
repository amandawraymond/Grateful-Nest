Welcome to the Grateful Nest!

This is a work in progress. I wanted to try out angularJS 1.5.6 components with UI Router.
Look at trello card to see what my next features are.

  on the docket: 
    1. make it so you can add more than one list_item to the thankful list
    2. make it so you can see the markdown after the list_item in saved inside textbox
    3. make sure the markdown capabilities are fully functional and provide helper text
    4. The above feature will aid in the UX and ease of user

Inspiration for this app is a "thankful journal" where you write down 10 things you are thankful for everyday before you go to bed. I would like to provide a "community thankful journal" where you can add your own and look through what others are thankful for. I would like to start this out as an anonymous posting for now, and later on add authentication/authorization, as well as, ability to save your own thankful notes and journal entries privately. I would like to allow for markdown in this on-line journal. I also would like to make sure that it is mobile-responsive.

Inspirations:
- iA writer
- Thankful Journals bought in WorldMarket
- Markdown preview/creator sites
- Post secret

Technologies: 
- Ruby on Rails (4.2.2)
- AngularJS (1.5.6)* with emphasis on components - newer for me
- UI Router (1.0.0) -  new for me 
- redcarpet gem for translate markdown to html
- bypass gem to search text for urls
- Sass
- Bootstrap 
- Font Awesome 


Future improvements:
- authentication
- authorization
- allow users to decorate their posts through background, images, colors
- pull in thankful quotes from an API to jazz up cards
