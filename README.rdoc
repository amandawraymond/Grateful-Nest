Inspiration for this app is a "thankful journal" where you write down 10 things you are thankful for everyday before you go to bed. I would like to provide a "community thankful journal" where you can add your own and look through what others are thankful for. I would like to start this out as an anonymous posting for now, and later on add authentication/authorization, as well as, ability to save your own thankful notes and journal entries privately. I would like to allow for markdown in this on-line journal. I also would like to make sure that it is mobile-responsive.

Inspirations:
iA writer
Thankful Journals bought in WorldMarket
Markdown preview/creator sites
Post secret

Technologies: 
Ruby on Rails (4.2.2)
AngularJS (1.5.6)* with emphasis on components
UI Router (1.0.0)*
redcarpet gem for translate markdown to html
bypass gem to search text for urls
Sass
Bootstrap 

* These two together were new for me, I wanted to try them out and test-drive a bit

Future improvements:
- authentication
- authorization
- allow users to decorate their posts through background, images, colors
- pull in thankful quotes from an API
